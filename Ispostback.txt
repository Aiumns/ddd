IsCallBack is a special kind of postback.

The only time IsCallBack is going to be true is if IsPostBack is also true.

Therefore their is no way to get to your "Page Called Back" code. See What is the difference between Page.IsPostBack and Page.IsCallBack?

The two variables can result in exactly 3 conditions:

IsPostBack and IsCallBack are both false: initial page load.
IsPostBack is true; IsCallBack is false: full postback occurred.
IsPostBack is true; IsCallBack is true: request came from ajax.
There is no situation in which IsPostBack will be false and IsCallBack will be true.

So your code should be:

if (!IsPostBack) {
    { 
        LblInfo.Text = "Initial Page Loaded"; 
    } 
} else {
    if (IsCallback) 
    { 
        LblInfo.Text = "Page Called Back"; 
    } else {
        LblInfo.Text = "Page Posted Back";
    }
}



“A postback is a request sent from a client to server from the same page, user is already working with.“

“A callback is generally a call for execution of a function after another function has completed.”


-------------Sql Function Limitation

Cannot access temporary tables from within a function.
