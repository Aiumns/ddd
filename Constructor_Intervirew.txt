Private constructors are used to prevent creating instances of a class when there are no instance fields or methods, such as the Math class, 
or when a method is called to obtain an instance of a class. If all the methods in the class are static, 
consider making the complete class static

A private constructor is a special instance constructor. It is commonly used in classes that contain static members only. 
This type of constructors is mainly used for creating singleton object. If you don't want 
the class to be inherited we declare its constructor private.

What is the difference between static and private constructor?

A static constructor cannot access non-static members. It executes before the first instance of a class. ... 
However, Private Constructor is used to restrict a class to be instantiated and to 
be inherited. Private Constructor is used whenever a class contains only static members.

When would you use a private constructor?

A singleton is a design pattern that allows only one instance of your class to be created, 
and this can be accomplished by using a private constructor. 
Yes and it is used to prevent instantiation and subsequently overriding. This is most often used in singleton classes.
